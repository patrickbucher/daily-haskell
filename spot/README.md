# Spot

The game _Spot_ is a board game named after the red spot of the _7up_ logo. It was released for the NES and Game Boy, the latter of which I played back in the nineties. Based on my fading memory and on a [gameplay video](https://youtu.be/uE2x6LlbPwg), the rules are as follows:

1. The game is played on a 7x7 grid with dark and light spots, which the diagonally opposite corners being occupied by the dark (top left, bottom right) or white (top right, bottom left) spot for the starting position.
2. The player take turns moving their spots to an empty field. A spot can be moved horizonally, vertically, or diagonally â€¦
    1. by one field, in which case the spot is _copied_, or
    2. by two fields, in which case the spot is _moved_.
3. The opponent's horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent spots are taken up by the spot being moved there.

The goal of the game is to cover as many fields as possible on the board.
