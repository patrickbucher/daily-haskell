# Day 2 (Sa, 2025-08-09)

Having been out all day long, I found time to work through chapter 2 of _Programming Haskell_.

# Day 1 (Fr, 2025-08-08)

First commit today after finishing chapter 1 of _Programming Haskell_. I got my setup to run and did all the exercises, which were rather easy.

I started reading chapter 1 of _Programming Haskell_ (Second Edition) by Graham Hutton. I already worked throuh half of the book five years ago, but now I'd like to get through.
