# Day 10 (Su, 2025-08-17)

I worked through the first part of chapter 7. Now I understand that `foldl` can be thought of in terms of forwarding an accumulator, while `foldr` builds up a chain of recursive function calls.

# Day 9 (Sa, 2025-08-16)

Having read chapter 6 quickly yesterday evening, I summarized it today and worked through the exercises, which were rather easy. (The nine months of working through the first three chapters of SICP really paid off!) Now comes the most interesting chapter for me of the first part: higher-order functions.

# Day 8 (Fr, 2025-08-15)

I worked through the extended Caesar cipher example and worked through all of the exercises, which were rather easy.

# Day 7 (Th, 2025-08-14)

I continued with chapter 5 and managed so summarize the first part. The second part is an extended example, which I save for later (or tomorrow).

# Day 6 (We, 2025-08-13)

Little time today; I started working through chapter 5 (on list comprehensions) in the morning.

# Day 5 (Tu, 2025-08-12)

I finished working through chapter 4, for which I wrote a rather terse summary. I'm not getting disciplined in leaving things awayâ€”the kind of discipline that _saves_ effort. As usual, I was not interested in the exercises dealing with formal definitions; I'm rather interested in how to express my thoughts in Haskell, for which this chapter had a couple of great exercises, forcing the reader to solve the same problem using various approaches. That's what I expect from a text book.

I now remember how much I struggled with the book five years ago. Functional programming really became second nature to me in the time since then. Re-visiting hard stuff is the best learning strategy for me. It takes time, but little effort, or rather effort distributed over time.

# Day 4 (Mo, 2025-08-11)

Today I received the book _Learn You a Haskell for Greater Good_. I only tried working through it on my commutes roughly ten years ago, but must have given up on it. Having read the introduction and the first chapter, the book seems dense, informal, and fun, but never to the point of being daft. I like it as an informal companion to _Programming Haskell_. Unfortunately, the book has no exercises.

In the evening, I started working through chapter 4 in _Programming Haskell_.

# Day 3 (Su, 2025-08-10)

I worked through chapter 3 in _Programming Haskell_.

# Day 2 (Sa, 2025-08-09)

Having been out all day long, I found time to work through chapter 2 of _Programming Haskell_.

# Day 1 (Fr, 2025-08-08)

First commit today after finishing chapter 1 of _Programming Haskell_. I got my setup to run and did all the exercises, which were rather easy.

# Day 0 (Th, 2025-08-07)

I started reading chapter 1 of _Programming Haskell_ (Second Edition) by Graham Hutton. I already worked throuh half of the book five years ago, but now I'd like to get through.
