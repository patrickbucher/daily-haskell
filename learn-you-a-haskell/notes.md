# Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!

## Starting Out

List commands to be run upon GHCi startup in `~/.ghci`.

`head` returns the first, `last` the last element of a list. `tail` returns all but the first, `init` all but the last elements of a list.

`cycle` replicates a list, and `repeat` replicates a single element _ad infinitum_; `replicate` repeats a single element for a given amount of times.
